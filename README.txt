CS/ECE 250: Computer Architecture

Hours Spent: Approximately 30 hours

Thoughts/impressions: MIPS is difficult to debug. No getting around it. What would have been incredibly simple in Java became equally difficult in MIPS

Programs: ard38_recurse.s, ard38_mvp.s

Help: Piazza, various TAs through recitation sections and TA hours, professor during lecture, Google (for understanding error messages)

Explanations:

Recurse program recursively finds the length of a string

MVP program takes an input of:
*Basketball player*
*ppg*
*apg*
*tpg*

and returns:
*Basketball player* *(ppg+apg)/tpg*

in descending order, then lists the MVP at the bottom. 

Both programs, to the best of my knowledge, work to the fullest extent.
